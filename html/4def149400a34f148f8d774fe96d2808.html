<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Consider a shrew, which moves across the forest for searching its prey (insect, worm, snails etc) , assume worm ranges of abundance from 0.003 to 0.01 and beetle ranges of abundance takes as half of worms. Assign worm handling time is 1 second and beetle handling time is 60 second.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Find whether the shrew gets more food unit time by</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><span style="line-height: 1.6;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;foraging only worms</span></li>
<li>&nbsp;foraging only beetle</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;foraging both worm and beetle.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Assume that beetle abundance equal to worm abundance and perform the simulation</p>
<p>3. Assume that beetle abundance double the worm abundance and perform the simulation</p>
<p>(Hint : Use the Optimal foraging simulator to perform calculations)</p>
