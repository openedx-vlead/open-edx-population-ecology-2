<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Find the optimal strategy for different species of pollinators ( example : hummingbird) with different species of plant ( for eg; a penstemon, &nbsp; &nbsp;which has a similar arrangement of flowers but a steeper decline in the caloric content with height).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hint: change the slope from 1.7 to 2.5 for simulating the above case.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The distance between the plants may vary from a meadow to meadow or &nbsp;the time spent in flying from one plant to another is differs with the distance between the plants. See how that will affects the optimal foraging strategy?</p>
